Hello!

I'm someone interested in the world of Frontend Development. As a developer, I'm always aware of the power of the internet. Since I see my profession as a hobby as well, I often share my projects on various platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub. Through these platforms, my goal is to contribute to others by sharing and collaborating with people.

Over the past one year, I have been continuously improving myself as a frontend developer. During this time, I have had the opportunity to work with HTML, CSS, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Vue and React. I have been particularly focusing on Vue projects recently to further advance my skills. Additionally, I have an interest in PHP and WordPress, among other libraries

I give great importance to staying updated on UI/UX trends. I continuously follow developments in the design world to maximize the user experience and translate these trends into my coding practices, adhering to the principle of "from design to code."

What matters to me is developing user-friendly and impactful web applications that bring value to my projects. I am always open to self-improvement and learning new things. I believe in teamwork, engaging in idea exchange, and collaborating with others to achieve better results.

When I'm not being a developer (actually, I'm always a developer), I love playing video games, Reading comics/mangas. Additionally, chaos makes me feel alive. Sometimes, it's nice to think of myself as a regular person (though I'm not entirely sure about that).

If you would like to get in touch, learn more about my projects, or collaborate, you can reach me using the contact information below.
